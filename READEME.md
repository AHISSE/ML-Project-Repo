One objective of this project is to correctly predicate the number of delayed flights in order to improve customer satisification. 

To accomplish this goal we will conduct mutiple binary classification machine learning processes to find the best model that accurately predicts the maximum number of delayed flights. 

We will first import the required python libraries to conduct the process.

Then we will import the data and define what defines a delayed flight and an on-time.

Then we will define the target variable and predictors.

From there will conduct our first machine learnign process, a Logisitic Regression Model.

After conducting the process, we will look at several different performance metrics to evaluate the model. 

- Confusion Matrix

  - Classification report

    The ROC Curve

    The model is also a Logisitic Regression Model, however now the target variable class imbalance is resolved.

    Again we look at the same metrics but with different results.

    Another attempt we conducted to resolve the weight class imbalance is SMOTW because we think the target variable class imbalance is severe enough to warrant a SMOTE does better with severe target variable class     
    imbalance problem.

    Now we move on to Decision Tree Model, which had similar to Logistic Regression Model with the SMOTE target variable class imbalance solution.

    And we will at the same performance metrics as before.

    Lastly, we conducted a Random Forest Machine Learning Process and we will us the same performance metrics to evaluate the models.
